The `semgrep test` and `semgrep validate` commands have been
correctly documented as EXPERIMENTAL (in semgrep --help).
Those commands are not GA yet and people should still
use the `semgrep scan --test` and `semgrep scan --validate` (or
the variants without the implicit "scan") commands (unless
they want to experiment with getting results faster and are ok
with incomplete coverage of the legacy `semgrep --test`
and `semgrep --validate`).
