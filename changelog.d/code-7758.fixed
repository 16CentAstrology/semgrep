taint-mode: Fixed what is considered a sink when a sink formula matches a
lambda expression: it is the lambda itself that is the sink, not the
individual statements in the lambda.

Example:

    function test() {
      // no longer generates finding
      // note that `log(taint)` is *not* a sink
      sink(() => { log(taint); return "ok" });
    }
