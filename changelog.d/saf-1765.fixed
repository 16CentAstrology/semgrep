Python (pro-only): Taint now correctly tracks through calls to class methods
within a class, via the `cls` parameter.

So for instance, we would be able to determine a source-to-sink
vulnerability in the following code snippet:
```
class A:
  def foo(self, x):
    sink(x)

  @classmethod
  def bar(cls):
    cls.foo(source)
```
